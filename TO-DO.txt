-Need to adjust Digital Isolator IC to have correct direction orientation for UART TX and RX transmission
-Need to begin tracing of PCB, along with proper component placement. 
-Need to ensure protection against reverse polarity, and other little things if I can find them. 
-Need to study and ensure return pathways are unobstructed. 
-Need to research and figure out if my power supply scheme is appropriate for the digital isolator IC
-Need to dig through BMS IC datasheet again to see if there are any other considerations to be made to make firmware development easier.
