-Need to ensure protection against reverse polarity, and other little things if I can find them. 
-Need to study and ensure return pathways are unobstructed. 
-Need to research and figure out if my power supply scheme is appropriate for the digital isolator IC
-Need to dig through BMS IC datasheet again to see if there are any other considerations to be made to make firmware development easier. 
-Need to place the RC filtering circuitry so that there is no obstruction for the return circuitry, then place it to work with the BMS IC
