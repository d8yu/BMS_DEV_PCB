1. Need to figure out if a 1uF or 1.5uF capacitor on the Voltage Channel Input lines is more appropriate
2. Need to make schematic symbol for the isolator IC.
3. Need to add Isolator IC and connect UART connections
4. Need to find thermistors and connect them to the BMS GPIO Pins
5. Need to calculate and find appropriate NPN transistor according to datasheet
6. Need to verify accuracy of gnds
